This repo contains two interpreters of the [Lox programming language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html):
- **jlox**: A tree-walk interpreter written in Java.
- **clox**: A single-pass bytecode compiler written in C.

The *jlox* and *clox* directories contain instructions on how to build the interpreter and use it to run Lox scripts.
